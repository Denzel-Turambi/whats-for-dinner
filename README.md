# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The goal of this application was to solve the problem that a lot of people have: "What am I going to eat?". Figuring out what to eat can be a long and complicated process, especially if you don't know what you're hungry for in the first place. Hopefully, this application can help you decide what you want to eat!

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I just finished my third week of mod 1 at Turing. I recieved the project specs on Teusday, and worked on it from Wednesday to Sunday.
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goal of this project was to work with Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a comprehensive application that allows you to generate recipe ideas.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Learned how to write CSS
- Learned how to write HTML

Challenges:
- Javascript was still a challenge for me
- Time management issues

To overcome these challenges, I did a lot of research and working with some cohort mates. For time management, I had some scheduling mix-ups on Saturday, which messed up my schedule for when I could work on this project. I was able to reset on Sunday and get some work done for this project.
